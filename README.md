# Bootstrapping Challenge
For this challenge we used bootstrapping to estimate a confidence interval for the average folk/country score from oun [Mod 2 project](https://github.com/flatiron-data-science/mod2_final_project). We chose this statistic because we use it frequently for comparison. Work is documented in the corresponding notebook [here](confidence_interval.ipynb).
